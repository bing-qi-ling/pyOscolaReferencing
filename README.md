# pyOscolaReferencing
A simple OSCOLA citation generator made in Python.

This was created as a kind of test to see if I could actually do anything like this. Some of the code has been corrected by ChatGPT, it's all poorly written, and there's numerous bugs that keep popping up.

When I say bugs, I mean that I am mega dumb and haven't coded it properly.

As always, no warranties expressed or implied, use it at your own risk. Perhaps just use it for fun, don't use it for any work in any format cause it might be wrong.

Have a look at ZoteroBib, it's free but probably closed source. It's meant to be good, but I haven't tried it.
